# Hangman Game

A console-based Hangman game implemented in C++.

## Introduction

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. Incorrect guesses lead to the drawing of a hangman figure. This implementation is a simple console version of the game.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. You will be presented with a word, represented by underscores.
3. Guess a letter.
4. If the guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
5. If the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
6. Continue guessing letters until you either complete the word or the hangman figure is fully drawn.

## Features

- Randomly selects words from a predefined list.
- Displays the hangman figure based on the number of incorrect guesses.
- Tracks guessed characters and prevents repeated guesses.
- Recognizes when the word is guessed correctly or when the hangman figure is complete.

## Implementation Details

- The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
